Uptime - a simple WPS class
===========================

Introduction
------------

The accompanying files implement a Workplace Shell class that shows the
current system uptime (time since boot).  Although there are several
utilities that do this, it seemed nice to make it a WPS class; it is
easy to move the information around the desktop, make shadows, etc.  It
would of course be rare to need more than one instance of this! Also,
this is dedicated to just one function, unlike (for example) PM Patrol. 

This is version 1.3, which contains facilities to select the method by
which the uptime is determined.


Installation
------------

Unpack the ZIP file (if you are reading this, you've probably done that
already).  Copy UPTIME.DLL to somewhere on the LIBPATH, and UPTIME.HLP
to somewhere on the HELP path (apart from '.', which isn't relevant
here). Leave the UPTIME.SYS device driver for now, and read the help text
about it once the class is working with the default uptime method.

Edit the REG.CMD file, and add the full path of the location of the
UPTIME.DLL file to the line currently containing just the UPTIME.DLL
name.  This shouldn't be necessary, but in my experience it works
better!

Run the REG.CMD file to register the object class.

Now run the CREATE.CMD file to create an instance on the desktop. 
Answer the questions.  The refresh interval defines the frequency with
which the display is updated.  This can always be changed by using the
Options page in the Properties notebook. Use T or S for the uptime method,
unless you have already installed the device driver.

That's it!

Use
---

Simply double click on the object to open its Watch view.  While open,
the object title text changes to show the system uptime.  To close,
display the popup menu (right mouse button) and select the Close View
menu item. 

Online help is also available via the Help item on the popup menu.

Uninstallation
--------------

Delete all objects of the 'uptime' class.  Run the DEREG.CMD file. 
reboot, and delete the UPTIME.DLL and UPTIME.HLP files.  If using the
device driver, remove its DEVICE= line from CONFIG.SYS, delete the
driver file, and reboot. 

The UPTIME.SYS device driver
----------------------------

The device driver can, if so desired, be used in isolation.  It provides
a device named UPTIME$, which can be opened in the usual way (the same
as a file) in any suitable programming language.  Once this is done, a
read operation will return four bytes which make up a 32 bit value
(least significant byte first).  This value is the system uptime in
seconds (more accurately, it is the time since the device driver
initialised). 

Revision history
----------------
1.0	Initial version.
1.1	Changed to use IRQ0 timer instead of swapfile date.
1.2	Changed to use choice of timer, swapfile date or result
	from device driver.
1.3	Revised device driver, and added BLDLEVEL information.
